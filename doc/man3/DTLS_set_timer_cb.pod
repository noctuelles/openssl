=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 typedef unsigned int (*DTLS_timer_cb)(SSL *s, unsigned int timer_us);

 void DTLS_set_timer_cb(SSL *s, DTLS_timer_cb cb);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This function sets an optional callback function for controlling the
timeout interval on the DTLS protocol. The callback function will be
called by DTLS for every new DTLS packet that is sent.

The callback should return the timeout interval in micro seconds.

The I<timer_us> parameter of the callback is the last set timeout
interval returned. On the first invocation of the callback,
this value will be 0.

If no timer callback is set, the default timeout value is 1 second.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

Returns void.

=head1 HISTORY

The DTLS_set_timer_cb() function was added in OpenSSL 1.1.1.
